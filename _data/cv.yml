        - Our work on <a href="https://mathai4ed.github.io/papers/papers/paper_11.pdf">
          "Gamifying Math Education using Object Detection"
          </a> was presented at the NeurIPS 2021 workshop on Math AI for Education (MATHAI4ED)
        - Led the development efforts for our core C++ vision library and prototyped new camera hardware devices.

      institution: Magic Leap
      year: Summer 2018
      description:
        - Researched and developed a deep learning based image recognition 
          and image comparison framework using tensorflow and python. Improved 
          accuracy for scene and image classification tests.
        - Implemented end-to-end transfer learning on the VGG-19 network by 
          creating a new dataset for image classification and compared different 
          feature detection and triplet based learning algorithms for image similarity.
