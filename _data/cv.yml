      institution: Magic Leap
      year: Summer 2018
      description:
        - Researched and developed a deep learning based image recognition 
          and image comparison framework using tensorflow and python. Improved 
          accuracy for scene and image classification tests.
        - Implemented end-to-end transfer learning on the VGG-19 network by 
          creating a new dataset for image classification and compared different 
          feature detection and triplet based learning algorithms for image similarity.
