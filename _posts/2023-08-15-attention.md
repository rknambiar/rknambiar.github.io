Before I explain what transformers are, let's talk about attention. I know there are already many great posts on this topic, but I wanted to write my own in an attempt to better understand and learn important concepts in machine learning. I have used some of the publicly available content in this post, so will try my best to cite them as needed.

We will be covering the following papers:
- [Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.0473.pdf)
- [Effective Approaches to Attention-based Neural Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.04025.pdf)
