Hello :wave:! I am a Research Software Engineer at Apple where I work on spatial computing and machine learning. Prior to this, I was a CVML Research Engineer at Tangible Play (Osmo) where I worked on building interactive educational games powered by computer vision and machine learning. I finished my Masters in Robotics from the University of Maryland, College Park in 2019 where I was working in the <a href="https://rcpsl.eng.uci.edu/people/" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800">RCPS Lab</a> with <a href="https://rcpsl.eng.uci.edu/yshoukry/" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800"> Dr. Yasser Shoukry</a>. 

I enjoy building products at the intersection of computing, computer vision and deep learning especially on resource constrained environments. I am also passionate about teaching and making AI more accessible.
